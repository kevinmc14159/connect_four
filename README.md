## How to Use

## How to Play
Players take turns entering a number for the column they want to drop their piece in. The piece will always land at the lowest unoccupied row for the column. If the column is full, no more pieces can be placed in that column. Once placed, pieces cannot be removed. The game goes on until a player manages to connect four of his/her pieces in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. At this point, the game ends and that player wins. If the whole board is full and nobody has won yet, the game ends in a draw.
